It also supports dynamic report generation with filtering by company or student, and displays summary statistics such as average salary. The project uses MySQL as the database and integrates ORM, prepared statements, and stored procedures for efficient and secure data access. This application is deployed on Google Cloud Platform for public access and demo purposes.
